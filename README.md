# Unity-TestStuff_FPSController

 Create a Test Stuff FPSController for your Unity projects.

 As one must aknowledge that as most examples, snippets, tutorials, etc, etc, need some sort of 
 "characterController" to work, thus one would not be able to test such if they do not already 
 have one to test stufff with. As such provided here is just a simple "testercontroller" for 
 testing stuff if the end-user needs such and does not already have something.
