Simple package setup:
---------------------


Quick Note: if you are opting to use the package, then the assets directory
and also the manual setup instructions and other such files are not needed as
they are not related to the package setup. As such, let us simply explain the
basic to get the package up and going quickly for whatever your testing
purposes may be.


Setup:
------

1) Open a new Unity project in Unity Hub.

2) Once the project is open, then start with a new empty scene.

3) Next, simply add a needed new layer called: Wall

4) Grab the package "DWG_TestStuff_FPSController" from
path: "Package/DWG_TestStuff_FPSController.unitypackage"

5) Import the "DWG_TestStuff_FPSController" asset / package into your
project.

6) Once the package "DWG_TestStuff_FPSController" is imported, you can then
navigate to the DWG/UBRS/"Scenes" dir and open the scene titled: "Demo
Scene"
